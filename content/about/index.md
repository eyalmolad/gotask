# My Info

Hi! My name is Eyal.

My love for computers and coding started at age of 5, when my parents bought me a brand-new ZX Spectrum computer (48K). As a kid in the eighties, I became a very passionate player of Chuckie Egg, Boulder Dash, and Manic Miner. This childhood passion soon turned into an interest in programming when at age 12, I started coding for fun using Basic and C on my PC. When I grew up, coding became my profession.

I served as Software Engineer and CTO at several startup companies, including [SimiGon][1] (LSE:SIM.L) (IPO at 2006), Datamills, and iRobinHood.

In 2010, I developed a software for automatic day-trading on the US stock market. I also spent some time trading myself.

In 2012, I co-founded <a href="http://cartcrunch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CartCrunch</a> (TechStars Boston &#8211; Fall 2012), a startup that created a system for grocery-store shopping list price-comparison. Our technology included a process of analyzing consumer receipts (using OCR) and building a real-time pricing database of tens of millions of products.

CartCrunch was acquired by <a href="http://songo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Songo Media</a> in 2015.

Since 2016, I have been on the <a href="https://www.datarails.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DataRails</a> R&D team where we focus on developing a financial analytics platform with data-driven insights.

In my free time, I enjoy running and hiking outdoors, analyzing stock market charts, investing in real-estate, and cooking. Currently I split my time between Europe and Israel.

Feel free to contact me in English, Hebrew, or Serbian.
